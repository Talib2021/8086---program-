# 8086 Assembly Code Integrated with C++

## Overview

This project demonstrates how 8086 assembly code can be integrated into a C++ program. The primary goal is to show the interaction between C++ and low-level assembly language code, enabling efficient hardware-level operations and simulating 8086 microprocessor instructions within a high-level language environment.

## Objectives

- **Integrate 8086 Assembly with C++**: Demonstrate how to use assembly code in C++ to interface with hardware or simulate low-level operations.
- **Leverage Low-Level Operations**: Use assembly language for tasks that require precise control over memory or specific microprocessor operations, such as bitwise operations, loops, and hardware interfacing.
- **Simulate 8086 Microprocessor**: Simulate 8086 instructions and operations within a C++ environment, allowing easier debugging and testing compared to hardware setups.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Assembly Language**: 8086 Assembly
- **Toolchain**: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), for compiling C++ and assembly code

## Features

- **Assembly Code Integration**: Easily integrate 8085 assembly code within C++ functions using `asm` blocks or external assembly files.
- **Microprocessor Simulation**: Simulate 8086 microprocessor instructions and their effect on memory and registers.
- **Efficient Low-Level Operations**: Use assembly code for specific tasks where performance is critical, such as arithmetic operations or bit manipulation.
